# Advanced-Data-Analysis-Techniques-and-Business-Insights
Objective:
To apply advanced data analysis techniques to derive actionable business insights. This 
includes predictive analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning approaches for 
forecasting and decision-making.
Tools Used :
● Google Sheets or Excel (for data preprocessing and basic analysis)
● Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) for modeling 
● Power BI or Tableau (optional for visualization)

➡️ Identified Issues in the data :
● Missing values in key attributes like customer demographic details.
● Outliers in the sales data affecting trend analysis.
● Inconsistent categorical variables (e.g., different labels for the same category

Steps to Follow:
● Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques (mean, median, 
mode).
● Detect and remove outliers using Z-score or IQR method. 
● Standardize categorical variables for consistency

➡️ Predictive Modeling for Sales Forecasting
Steps to Follow:
- Apply Linear Regression to predict sales based on marketing spend and seasonality.
- Implement Logistic Regression to classify whether a customer will churn based on 
historical data.
- Use Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet) to predict future monthly sales
  
➡️ Statistical Analysis for Business Insights
Steps to Follow:
1. ANOVA: To compare sales performance across different regions.
2. Hypothesis Testing: To validate the impact of promotions on sales growth.
3. Factor Analysis: To identify key drivers influencing customer purchase decisions
   
➡️ Machine Learning for Customer Segmentation
Steps to Follow:
● Use Decision Trees to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
● Implement K-Means Clustering to group customers into different spending 
categories.
● Apply Ensemble Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) for enhanced prediction 
accuracy.

 ➡️ Insights & Recommendations
Key Findings:
● High-Value Customers: Identified through clustering; targeted offers should be 
provided.
● Sales Forecasting: Predictive models indicate seasonal spikes, allowing inventory 
optimization.
● Churn Prevention: Logistic regression helps in identifying at-risk customers early.

Recommended Business Actions:
● Personalize marketing strategies based on customer segmentation results.
● Adjust stock levels based on time series forecasting to avoid overstocking or 
shortages.
● Implement customer retention programs for segments with high churn probability
